# EggRoll FAQ

## Why Go?

The Cartesi Machine, a high-performance RISC-V emulator, excels in its domain.
Yet, no emulator can truly rival bare metal performance.
Utilizing scripting languages like JavaScript or Python within the Cartesi Machine results in double emulationâ€”first for the Cartesi Machine and then for the language interpreter.
To address this, one should use languages that compile directly into RISC-V machine code, like Go, Rust, or C++.
We selected Go for the EggRoll framework due to its exceptional performance and ease of adoption.
